First of all thanks for buying this asset!

For playing fps demo like you see on demo video you need to download free fps controller from Unity Asset Store.

This one will be perfect - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/mini-first-person-controller-174710

Drag n drop "First Person Controller" prefab to the scene and choose tag "Player", everything will run like you see on demo video.
